## Training the model
To build the model, we perform the following:
1. Importing the dataset
2. Cleaning the text
3. Creating a ‘Bag of Words’ and "TF-IDF"
4. Training and classification
5. Evaluation.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. K Nearest Neighbour (Accuracy: 77.50%)
2. Support Vector Machine (Accuracy: 82.50%)
3. Naive Bayes (Accuracy: 80.00%)
4. Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 84.00%)
5. Decission Tree (Accuracy: 71.00%)
6. Random Forest (Accuracy: 76.00%)
